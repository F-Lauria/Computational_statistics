# Computational_statistics

This repository contains three assignment from the course Computational statistics. Different topics are discussed in all the assignments, some of them are: Student t-test, Welch t-test, Bootstrap permutation and Cross Validation strategy. Everything was developed using R.

## General info
In each directory you can find the code, the report and the description of the assignment. For assignment 3 you can find the code as appendix of the report. Contents of each assignment:

* Assignment1: Hypergeometric distribution, Poisson distribution, Exponential distribution applied to a real case. Experiment differences between Welch t-test and Student t-test part 1
* Assignment2: Paired t-test, Bootstrap sampling. Experiment differences between Welch t-test and Student t-test part 2
* Assignment3: Shrinkage methods (Lasso and Ridge regresson) and cross validation. 

## Code

Code assignment 3 as appendix in [report](https://github.com/F-Lauria/Computational_statistics/blob/master/Assignment3/report/Report.pdf)

## Technologies
All the project was created with:
* R

## Setup
Standard R libraires execpt for assignment 3. In that case you will need:
* MLmetrics library
* tidyverse library
* caret library 
* glmnet library
